/*
Oxygen
Sleek, minimal theme inspired by Things app aesthetic
Clean backgrounds, subtle warmth, refined accents

NOTE: Oxygen colors are defined in the base theme (src/scss/variables/dynamic-color.scss)
This file is intentionally left empty - Oxygen is the BASE theme, not an override.
All Oxygen styling comes from the base .theme-light and .theme-dark classes.
Other color schemes (Minimal, Atom, Things, etc.) override the Oxygen base.
